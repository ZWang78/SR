This repository contains the implementation of a multi-scale MRI super-resolution (SR) framework developed using PyTorch. Our framework is built on a distillation-driven conditional diffusion model with a focus on 1.5T-to-7T MRI SR, incorporating advanced guidance mechanisms like bias field correction and gradient nonlinearity correction. The progressive distillation strategy enables a lightweight student model to achieve high-resolution outputs comparable to the teacher model while significantly reducing computational complexity.

While adhering to the paperâ€™s design, some implementation details have been adjusted for broader use cases and efficient training. Specifically:
- Employed the ResNet block and hierarchical feature concatenation for diffusion models.
- Applied multiscale attention mechanisms to better capture global and local anatomical features.
- Used student-teacher feature matching during distillation for precise structural alignment.
- Introduced a progressive subgoal strategy for refining MRI resolutions (e.g., 1.5T to 3T and 3T to 7T).
